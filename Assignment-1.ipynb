    "#  Q.Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "#  ans:Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "# 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python provides support for object-oriented programming through classes, objects, and inheritance.\n",
    "# 2.Imperative programming: Python allows for imperative programming through procedural programming constructs such as functions, loops, and conditional statements.\n",
    "# 3.Functional Programming: Python provides functional programming constructs such as first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures.\n",
    "# 4.Procedural programming: Python provides support for procedural programming through its functions and modules, which allow for code organization and reuse.\n",
    "# 5.Scripting: Python can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive tasks, extract data from files, or perform system administration tasks.\n",
    "# In essence, Python provides a versatile and flexible environment that can accommodate different programming styles, making it a great choice for a wide range of tasks and projects."
