    "# 2. 'w': This mode is used to open a file in write mode. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (i.e. cleared) before writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n",
    "# 3. 'x': This mode is used to create a file if it doesn't exist, and open it in write mode. If the file already exists, an error will occur.\n",
    "# 4. 'a': This mode is used to open a file in append mode. Data is written to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n",
    "# 5. 'b': This mode is used to open a file in binary mode. This mode should be used for non-text files, such as image or audio files.\n",

    "# Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "# ans:\n",
    "# The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function in Python.\n",
    "# It is important to close a file after it has been opened and used for several reasons:\n",
    "# 1.It frees up system resources: When a file is opened, the operating system assigns certain resources to that file, such as a file descriptor. \n",
    "# If the file is not closed properly, these resources may remain allocated, which can cause problems for other processes that need those resources.\n",
    "#  2.It ensures data integrity: When data is written to a file, it is usually buffered in memory first before being written to the physical storage medium.\n",
    "# If a file is not closed properly, the data in the buffer may not be written to the file, which can cause data corruption or loss.\n",
    "#  3.It prevents data leaks: If a file is not closed properly, it may still be accessible to other processes or users on the system.\n",
    "#    This can lead to sensitive data being leaked or compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To close a file in Python, we can simply call the close() method on the file object, like this:\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
